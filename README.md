Evolutionary Hill Climbing with Neural Network

This script was part of my 12 month Work Integrated Learning project at university.

It is an Artificial Neural Network written from scratch, with Evolutionary Hill Climbing as the learning algorithm. It was designed to be customisable, and easily integrated into the Unity Game engine.
